							<h1>Elderly People</h1>
							<p>Elderly people, also known as seniors or older adults, typically refer to individuals who are 65 years of age or older. As people age, they may experience various physical and cognitive changes, which can impact their mobility, independence, and overall well-being. Some common issues faced by elderly people include chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis, cognitive decline, mobility issues, falls, and social isolation. However, there are many resources available to support the aging population, such as healthcare services, housing options, and community programs that promote social connection and engagement. By providing adequate support and care for the elderly population, we can help to ensure that they can age with dignity and maintain a good quality of life.</p>
